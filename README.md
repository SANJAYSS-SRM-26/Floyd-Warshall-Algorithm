# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in C

This repository contains an implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm in C, which is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

## Description

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). This implementation uses a 2D array to represent the graph and prints the shortest distance matrix.
